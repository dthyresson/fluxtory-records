    "profile": "Independent record label from Manchester, UK, between 1978 and 1992.\r\n\r\nOn 19 May 1978, the TV presenter [a=Anthony H. Wilson] started The Factory, a series of club nights at the PSV/[l=The Russel Club] in Hulme, Manchester. Among the bands billed for the four opening nights were [a=The Durutti Column], [a=Cabaret Voltaire], and [a=Joy Division]. The poster for the evenings was designed by [a=Peter Saville (2)], who soon became a partner of Wilson and [a=Alan Erasmus]. In October 1979, producer [a=Martin Hannett] joined as a director too, followed in 1980 by [a=Rob Gretton] (manager of [a=Joy Division] and [a=New Order]) as fifth partner.\r\n\r\nThe club night was a success and led to the release of the double 7\" EP \"[r=11395]\" in January 1979. This EP marked the beginnings of Factory as a record label and featured bands that played at The Factory. When Wilson told Saville that their EP would be FAC 1, Saville replied that his first poster for the club was FAC 1 and the EP would be FAC 2. \r\n\r\nFactory set up its first headquarters in Erasmus' flat on 86 Palatine Road, Didsbury, Manchester, where it resided until 1990 (a blue BBC plaque was erected there in June 2017). It then moved to 1 Charles Street, Manchester, and was allocated catalogue number FAC 251.\r\n\r\nThe company [l=Factory Communications Ltd.] (FCL) was officially established on 24 October 1980.\r\n\r\nIn October 1989, Factory launched the label [l=Factory Classical].\r\n\r\nIn September 1991, news leaked out that Factory was near bankruptcy, and some record companies, including [l=Mute], [l=London Records], and [l=Warner Bros. Records], made bids on the label. The label was not sold though, and claimed it had sorted out its finances. This proved not to be the case, and on \"Black Monday\", 23 November 1992, Factory Records went into receivership with a ¬£2.5 million debt. A last-minute saving arrangement with [l=London Records] collapsed when it became clear that, thanks to their no-contract deal, New Order ‚Äîand not Factory‚Äî owned the rights to their material. \r\n\r\nFactory pioneered indie label principles such as the 50/50 profit share, and most of their record deals (until the later years of the label) were done with a handshake and not a contract.\r\n\r\nFactory constructed its own history by cataloging not only records, cassettes and videos, but also important events, posters, badges, TV programmes, concerts, T-shirts, buildings, stationery, advertising campaigns, etc. (see below).\r\n\r\nIn 1994, Wilson launched a new label, [l=Factory Too], with some releases coming out in conjunction with London Records. He also released a series of anthologies and re-releases from the Factory back catalogue via London under the name [l=Factory Once]. \r\nHe then started the label [l=Factory Records Limited], this time without a cooperation with London Records. \r\nAll labels quietly disappeared around 1998. This was followed by a short-lived digital download project called \"music33.com\". \r\nIn December 2004, Wilson announced that he was launching the \"fourth iteration of the Factory imprint\", [l=F4 Records], again failing to amount to much. \r\n\r\nMany titles from the original Factory catalogue have been reissued by the [l=LTM (4)] label. In an attempt to preserve the Factory brand and name, LTM owner James Nice, together with Alan Erasmus, Peter Saville and Tony Wilson's son Oliver, set up [l=Factory Records Ltd.] in June 2010. However, the idea was never seriously pursued and given up after one release only. Since March 2013, Factory Records Ltd. is owned by Saville alone.\r\n\r\nA dramatised history of Factory Records is portrayed in the movie \"[m=69215]\" (2002).\r\n\r\nMartin Hannett died at age 42 on 18 April 1991, as a result of heart failure. He was buried in Southern Cemetery, Manchester.\r\nRobert L. Gretton died at age 46 on 15 May 1999, of a heart attack. He was buried in Southern Cemetery, Manchester.\r\nAnthony H. Wilson died at age 57 on 10 August 2007, of a heart attack, already suffering from renal cancer. He was buried in Southern Cemetery, Manchester.\r\n\r\nNote: The label has been known on releases under differing names: starting as \"Factory\", then \"Factory Records\" and later back to just \"Factory\" again.\r\nNote: For unofficial releases, use [l=Factory (2)].\r\n\r\nNon-musical items with catalogue numbers:\r\nFAC 1: Poster \"Use Hearing Protection / The Factory\"\r\nFAC 3: Poster \"The Factory October 20th\"\r\nFAC 4: Poster \"The Factory December\"\r\nFAC 7: Stationery\r\nFAC 8: \"Menstrual Eggtimer\" (by Linder Sterling); unrealised concept except a napkin drawing\r\nFAC 9: \"The Factory Flick\"; 8mm film shown at Scala Cinema, London on 13 September 1979\r\nFAC 15: \"Zoo Meets Factory Half-Way\"; Leigh Festival from 25 to 27 August 1979 (Leigh being midpoint between Zoo's home in Liverpool and Manchester).
